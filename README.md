# Image Classifier

*This project has been accomplished as part of Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Projects*

# Project Overview
In this project, I have implemented an image classfication application on a dataset of Oxford Flower images trained on deep learning model, then I have used the trained model to classify flower image type. This has been developed in Jupyter Notebook (IPython) then I've converted the code to Python code that runs from command line to make sure it's achievable on both envionment.

## Project Description
In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset from Oxford of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.
